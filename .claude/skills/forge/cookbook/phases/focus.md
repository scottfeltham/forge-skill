# Focus Phase Guide

**Purpose**: Clarity - What are you actually building?

## Key Question

Can you explain what you're building to someone unfamiliar with it in under two minutes, and have them understand both the problem and what success looks like?

## Required Outputs

1. **Problem Statement** - What problem exists and for whom?
2. **Target Users** - Who specifically will use this?
3. **Success Criteria** - Testable outcomes (not vague aspirations)
4. **System Context Diagram** - C4 Level 1 showing system boundaries
5. **Scope Boundaries** - What you explicitly WON'T build

## Success Criteria Quality

Bad: "The system should be fast"
Good: "Page loads in under 2 seconds on 3G connections"

Bad: "Users should find it easy to use"
Good: "New users complete onboarding in under 3 minutes without help"

## C4 Level 1: System Context

Shows your system as a box in the center with:
- Users/actors on the outside
- External systems it integrates with
- Data flows between them

## Completion Checklist

- [ ] Problem statement clearly articulates the pain point
- [ ] Target users are specific (not "everyone")
- [ ] Success criteria are measurable and testable
- [ ] System context diagram exists
- [ ] Out-of-scope items are explicitly listed

## Common Mistakes

- Starting with solutions instead of problems
- Vague success criteria that can't be tested
- Scope that's too large for one cycle
- Skipping the "what we won't build" section

## Next Phase

When Focus is complete, advance to **Orchestrate** where you'll break the work into session-sized pieces.
