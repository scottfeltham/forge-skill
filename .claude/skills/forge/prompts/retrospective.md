# Retrospective Prompts

Use these prompts to guide users through cycle retrospectives.

## Opening

```
Let's reflect on this cycle. A good retrospective helps us improve.
I'll ask a few questions - be honest, there are no wrong answers.
```

## What Went Well

```
**What Went Well?**

Think about practices, tools, or approaches that were effective:

1. What are you proud of from this cycle?
2. What would you definitely do again?
3. What tools or techniques helped?
4. Were there any pleasant surprises?
```

### Follow-up Prompts
- "Can you give a specific example?"
- "What made that approach effective?"
- "Should we capture this as a pattern for future cycles?"

## What Could Improve

```
**What Could Improve?**

Think about challenges, frustrations, or inefficiencies:

1. What was harder than expected?
2. Where did you get stuck or slow down?
3. What would you do differently next time?
4. Were there any recurring problems?
```

### Follow-up Prompts
- "What was the root cause?"
- "How might we prevent this next time?"
- "Should we capture this as an anti-pattern to avoid?"

## Action Items

```
**Action Items**

Based on our discussion, what specific changes should we make?

1. What will you START doing?
2. What will you STOP doing?
3. What will you CONTINUE doing?
```

## Learning Capture

After discussion, prompt to record learnings:

```
Let me capture these insights for future reference:

**Successes to remember:**
- [Capture as 'success' learning]

**Things to avoid:**
- [Capture as 'failure' learning]

**Patterns to reuse:**
- [Capture as 'pattern' learning]

**Process improvements:**
- [Capture as 'process' learning]
```

## Metrics Review

```
**Metrics Review**

Let's look at the numbers:

- Planned tasks: [X]
- Completed tasks: [Y]
- Completion rate: [Z]%

- Estimated duration: [X]
- Actual duration: [Y]

How do you feel about these numbers?
```

## Quick Retrospective (5 min)

For shorter cycles or time constraints:

```
Quick Retro - Answer in one sentence each:

1. 😊 Highlight: What was the best part?
2. 😤 Frustration: What was the hardest part?
3. 💡 Learning: What's one thing you learned?
4. 🎯 Action: What's one thing to change next time?
```

## Team Retrospective Format

For cycles with multiple contributors:

```
**Team Retrospective**

Each person shares:
1. One thing that went well
2. One thing that could improve
3. One appreciation for a teammate

Then together:
- Vote on most important improvement
- Define one action item
- Assign owner for action item
```
